Create separate images per channel from a directory of images

As: a user
I want to: get 3xN images, one per channel from N RGB images
Desired outcome: A new folder with the monochromatic images


1. The program accepts as input a folder containing PNG image
    1.1 If dir is empty, raise an error and terminate
    1.2 If there are non-PNG images, then warn user and process
        the PNG ones
    1.3 If corrupt images, warn user and process the rest
    1.4 If no permission to read dir, raise error and terminate
2. Collect all valid images from dir -> path_list 
3. Create the output folder at the same level as the input folder and name it as input folder + suffix "_channels"
    3.1 If out already exists -> add + "_{timestamp}"
    3.2 If no permission to write -> error and terminate
4. Loop over valid images
    4.1 For each channel
        4.1.1 Create the monochromatic image
        4.1.2 save it in output dir by using the input file name + suffix (r,g,b)
